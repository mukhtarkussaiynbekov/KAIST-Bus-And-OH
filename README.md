# KAIST Bus And Operating Hours

Check out the app in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/kaist-bus-and-operating-hours/id1555938858?l=en&fbclid=IwAR2RVZoF8KWJSYp-BrcUlNi_irIE4buxUS0SzcjE1J6xfm0Smwly_2FecsA">Apple App Store</a>.

Implemented cross-platform mobile application that shows bus timetable and operating hours of some facilities at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Got motivated by JaeRyoung Ka's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JaeRyoungKa/KAIST-BUS-2.0.git">KAIST BUS 2.0</a> and Anuar Talipov's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AnuarTB/doesitwork.git">Does it work?</a>

## Installation
**Note**: This installation guide was referenced from [The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2020 edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) taught by Stephen Grider.

### MacOS
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS version of Node.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Clone Guide") this repository to your preferred directory.
3. Open terminal and navigate to the directory that has been generated by above step.
4. Install the dependencies by running ```npm install``` in your terminal.
5. Attempt to start the application by running ```npm start``` in your terminal.
6. You may get prompted to install the Expo tools globally. You should type ```Y``` and press enter in your terminal. If you get permission errors, then follow below steps.
7. In your terminal run this command to create a new global install path:  ```mkdir ~/.npm-global```
8. Then, run this command to tell npm about it:  ```npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'```
9. Run ```ps -o comm= $$``` to determine which shell you are currently using (It will either be **bash** or **zsh**).
10. If you are using **zsh**, create a zshrc profile by running ```nano ~/.zshrc```. If you are using **bash**, create a bash_profile by running ```nano ~/.bash_profile```
11. Inside of this file add the following text:
```export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH```
12. On your keyboard press CTL + X to exit. Press y to save and hit enter to write the changes.
13. Exit your terminal completely and then reopen it.
14. In your terminal change back into your project directory.
15. Install the global expo-cli tools to the new location by running ```npm install expo-cli --global```
16. After the tools finish installing, run ```npm start```

### Windows
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS version of Node.
2. Install Git on your system: https://git-scm.com/download/win. When you install Git for Windows this will also include the GitBash terminal. Since it is a bash emulator, it will allow you to type the same commands that are typed in a terminal on macOS.
3. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Clone Guide") this repository to your preferred directory. **DO NOT attempt to use a network drive or cloud-synced drive like Google Drive, Dropbox etc. The project files should be extracted to the C:\Users\YourUserName directory.**
4. Open the GitBash terminal application.
5. In the terminal change into your user's directory by running ```cd absolute_or_relative_path_to_your_project_directory```
6. Once you have verified that you are in the correct directory, run ```npm install```
7. Install the expo-cli tools by running ```npm install expo-cli --global```
8. After the dependencies have installed, attempt to run ```npm start```
9. You may get a message that the expo-cli tools are not installed.
10. To resolve this, we need to make sure NPM has been added to our environment variables. Open the Windows search bar and type "environment". Select "Edit the System Environment Variables".
11. Click "Environment Variables".
12. Double Click "Path" under "System Variables".
13. Click the "New" button and add the following path:
```%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm```
14. Click OK and apply changes.
15. Close out of your GitBash terminal completely and reopen.
16. Change back into your project directory by running ```cd absolute_or_relative_path_to_your_project_directory```
17. Run ```npm start```
